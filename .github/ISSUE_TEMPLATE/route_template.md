**Summary**  
Provide a brief overview of what needs to be done. Describe what routes or functionality you need to add.

**Route Details**

- **Route Path**: `/api/your-new-route`
- **Method**: `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE`
- **Description**: Describe the purpose of the route and what it should do.
- **Expected Input**: List the expected request body or parameters (e.g., `id`, `name`, `email`).
- **Expected Output**: Describe what the response will look like (e.g., success or failure message, data format).

**Steps to Implement**

- [ ] Create the route handler function.
- [ ] Set up validation for request data (if applicable).
- [ ] Ensure correct HTTP status codes are used for responses.
- [ ] Test the route using Postman or other API testing tools.
- [ ] Document the route in the project README or API documentation.

**Dependencies**  
List any dependencies that need to be installed or configured for this route (e.g., libraries, middleware, etc.).

**Testing**  
Describe how the route will be tested (unit tests, integration tests, manual testing).

**Additional Notes**  
Any other relevant information or considerations about this task.

**Example**  
Include any examples of requests and responses if possible:

- **Request Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
  ```
